	Use this class to encapsulate and/or aggregate multiple scoring functions so that it can be passed as an argument for scoring in scikit's cross_val_score function.
	Instances of this class are also callables, with signature as needed by `cross_val_score`.

		Create a new instance of MultiScorer.


		Parameters
		----------
		metrics: dict
			The metrics to be used by the scorer.
			The dictionary must have as key a name (str) for the metric and as value a tuple containing the metric function itself and a dict literal of the additional named arguments to be passed to the function.
			The metric function should be one of the `sklearn.metrics` function or any other callable with the same signature: `metric(y_real, y, **kwargs)`.

	def get_results(self, metric=None, fold='all'):
		'''
		Get the results of a specific or all the metrics.
		This method should be called after the object itself has been called so that the metrics are applied.

		Parameters
		----------
		metric: str or None (default)
			The given name of a metric to return its result(s). If omitted the results of all metrics will be returned.

		fold: int in range [1, number_of_folds] or 'all' (Default)
		 	Get the metric(s) results for the specific fold.
			The number of folds corresponds to the number of times the instance is called.
			If its value is a number, either the score of a single metric for that fold or a dictionary of the (single) scores for that fold will be returned, depending on the value of `metric` parameter.
			If its value is 'all', either a list of a single metric or a dictionary containing the lists of scores for all folds will be returned, depending on the value of `metric` parameter.

		Returns
		-------
		metric_result_for_one_fold
			The result of the designated metric function for the specific fold, if `metric` parameter was not omitted and an integer value was given to `fold` parameter.
			If  the value of `metric` does not correspond to a metric name, `None` will be returned.

		all_metric_results_for_one_fold: dict
			A dict having as keys the names of the metrics and as values their results for the specific fold.
			This will be returned only if `metric` parameter was omitted and an integer value was given to `fold` parameter.

		metric_results_for_all_folds: list
			A list of length number_of_folds containing the results of all folds for the specific metric, if `metric` parameter was not omitted and value 'all' was given to `fold`.
			If  the value of `metric` does not correspond to a metric name, `None` will be returned.

		all_metric_results_for_all_folds: dict of lists
			A dict having as keys the names of the metrics and as values lists (of length number_of_folds) of their results for all folds.
			This will be returned only if `metric` parameter was omitted and 'all' value was given to `fold` parameter.

		Raises
		------
		UserWarning
			If this method is called before the instance is called for evaluation.

		ValueError
			If the value for `fold` parameter is not appropriate.
